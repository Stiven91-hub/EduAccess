# EduAccess
EduAccess â€“ A simple, student-friendly application/website built with Java, HTML, CSS, and MySQL. Designed to give school learners easy access to digital textbooks and past exam papers, it helps reduce the need to carry heavy books while making past papers more accessible for study.  

A lightweight educational resource platform built with Java and MySQL. Students can browse or download textbooks and past papers online, while the system provides quick search and responsive design for mobile use. This project is ideal as a starter educational tool or as a learning resource for Java web development.  

During development, challenges included database connection errors, handling large file uploads, and ensuring the site was mobile responsive. These issues were resolved by configuring the correct database drivers, setting file upload size limits, and improving CSS for mobile layouts.
